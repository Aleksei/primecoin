Primecoin High Performance Version
==================================

This is the high performance version of Sunny King's Primecoin tree.

Features:
 * Use GMP for bignum calculations in the mining threads
 * Replaced some bignum calculations with 64-bit arithmetic inside the sieve
 * Reduced the amount of memory allocations
 * L1 and L2 cache optimizations
 * Process only 10% of base primes when weaving the sieve
 * Configurable sieve size

Intro
---------------------
Primecoin is a free open source cryptocurrency that implements the first
scientific computing proof-of-work for cryptocurrencies. The unique
proof-of-work design searches for rare prime formations, providing
experimental value for mathematicians to further understand the nature and
distribution related to prime number, a simple yet mysterious construct of
arithmetic that continues to baffle the top minds of mankind.

Upgrade
--------------------
First backup wallet. Uninstall previous version and then follow setup
instructions. Double check balance after completing setup and starting up
client.

Setup
-----
Complete windows setup procedure and run Primecoin (Qt).

Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run bitcoin-qt.exe.

Bitcoin-Qt is the original Bitcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Bitcoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
